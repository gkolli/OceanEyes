Filtering Ocean Data to Isolate Various Marine Mammal Sounds

Final Project for EECE 2520 - Linear Systems

Objective: "The input time domain signal you are provided contains the vocalization signals of a fin whale (20 Hz centered
calls) and a humpback whale song (50 Hz to 700 Hz) received simultaneously by a
hydrophone (underwater microphone). The objective of this project is to isolate the fin
whale call by filtering out the humpback whale song. You will need a low pass filter of
sufficiently high-order (> 2) to eliminate the humpback whale song sufficiently in the
output signal."

Signal Processing (in both time-domain and frequency-domain) was completed in MATLAB
